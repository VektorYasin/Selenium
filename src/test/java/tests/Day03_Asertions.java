    //what is the difference between "test assertion" and "test verification"?
    //Test execution stops if one of the assertion fails. This is hard assertion
    //test execution continues even if test verification fails.
    //verification is like "IF STATEMENT".
    //assertion stops after assertion fails. Verification continues even after fails.
    //Jnuit assertions are hard assertion.
    //If statement is verification.
    //TestNG has soft assertion as well.
    //hard assertion is mostly used in market. Ä±t is preffered.
    //to fix the issue, use hard assertion.
    //Hard assertion: If the execution stops in failure, it is called as hard assertion
    //verification: if the execution continues, it is called as verification.
